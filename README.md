# PulseCheck

PulseCheck is a groundbreaking solution engineered to detect and interpret anomalies in electrocardiogram (ECG) readings using the power of python programming. It employs various python libraries to harness the machine learning algorithms and modelling capabilities to analyze and pinpoint irregular heartbeat or cardiac rythm anomalies with exceptional accuarcy. The system is evaluated based on AUC metrics and later validated for performance efficiency.
